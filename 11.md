#### 11.Container With Most Water
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, a<sub>i</sub>). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, a<sub>i</sub>) and (i, 0). <u>Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container</u>, such that the container contains the most water.
Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

__notice:__ any two lines can form a container. You don't need to think about lines between the boundaries. (compare with 42. Trapping Rain Water)

__idea:__ First line and last line can be an obvious potential candidate because of the width.
The area is decided by smaller line and the width.
So, all other containers are less wide and thus would need a higher water level in order to hold more water. The smaller one of first and last line doesnâ€™t support a higher water level and can thus be safely removed from further consideration, and we can move the frist line to find the next candidate.

__time:__ O(n), n is #integers

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int start = 0, end = height.length - 1;
        int water = 0;
        while(start < end){
            int tmp = (end - start) * Math.min(height[start], height[end]);
            water = Math.max(water, tmp);

            if(height[start] < height[end]){
                start++;
            }else{
                end--;
            }
        }        
        return water;
    }
}
```
