#### 371.Sum of Two Integers
Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

__idea:__ Think about bitwise operation. Add operation can be divided into 2 parts, pure add bits on current position with carry and calculate carry for the left bit. XOR can complete the first step and AND can complete the second step.

__time:__ O(n), n is bits of integer.

```java
class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        //stop calculation until no carry
        if(b == 0){
            return a;
        }
        int sum = a ^ b;
        int carry = (a & b) << 1;
        return getSum(sum, carry);
    }
}
```
