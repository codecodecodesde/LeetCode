#### 292.Nim Game
You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: there is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.
Both of you are very clever and have <u>optimal strategies</u> for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.
For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.

__Idea:__ Brainteaser  
The first one who got the number that is multiple of 4 will lost, otherwise he/she will win.  
<u>proof:</u>
* ```n = 4```
no matter which number that that first player, the second player would always be able to pick the remaining number.
* ```4 < n < 8``` the first player can reduce the initial number into 4 accordingly, which will leave the death number 4 to the second player. i.e. The numbers 5, 6, 7 are winning numbers for any player who got it first.
* ```n = 8``` no matter which number that the first player picks, it would always leave the winning numbers (5, 6, 7) to the second player. Therefore, 8 % 4 == 0, again is a death number.
* ```x * 4 < n < (x + 1) * 4 ``` the first player can reduce the initial number into x * 4, which is the death number.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 4 != 0;
    }
}
```
