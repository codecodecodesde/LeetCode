#### 74.Search a 2D Matrix
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
* Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
* The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 3
Output: true
```  

__idea:__ treat the 2D matrix as a sorted array. make a tansfer between index in 1D array and index in 2D array and then use general binary search.

__time:__ O(logn), n is #nums in the matrix.s


```java
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        if(matrix == null || matrix.length == 0 || matrix[0].length == 0){
            return false;
        }

        int row = matrix.length;
        int col = matrix[0].length;
        int start = 0, end = row * col - 1;

        if(matrix[0][0] > target || matrix[end/col][end%col] < target){
            return false;
        }

        while(start < end){
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            int mid_x = mid/col;
            int mid_y = mid%col;
            if(matrix[mid_x][mid_y] == target){
                return true;
            }else if(matrix[mid_x][mid_y] < target){
                start = mid + 1;
            }else{
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return matrix[start/col][start%col] == target;
    }  
}
```
