#### 136.Single Number
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
requirement: <u>linear runtime</u> and <u>no extra memory</u>

__Idea:__ We can scan the array and do XOR continuously. Because A XOR A == 0, the XOR result of elements appear twice is 0. What'more, because XOR is commutative, the order of items in this array doesn't matter. So, only the single number will be left in the end.

__time:__ O(n)ï¼Œn is #nums


```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            ans ^= nums[i];
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
