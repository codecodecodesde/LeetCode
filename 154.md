#### 154.Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum element.
The array may contain duplicates.
```
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]    Output: 0
```
Note:
This is a follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array". Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

__idea:__ the difference between 154 and 153 is that there is an extra condition in 154, `nums[mid] == nums[end]`. Under thie condition, we're not sure the position of minimum in mid's left or right, and we only know we can eliminate the nums[end] safely.

__time:__ O(n), n is #nums in the array. `e.g. [1,1,1,1]`

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0, end = nums.length - 1;

        while(start < end){
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if(nums[mid] > nums[end]){
                start = mid + 1;
            }else if(nums[mid] < nums[end]){
                end = mid;
            }else{
                end--;
            }
        }
        return nums[start];
    }
}
```
