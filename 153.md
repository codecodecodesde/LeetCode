#### 153.Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum element.
```
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] -> [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]  return 0
```
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

__idea:__ discuss this question in following 2 conditions:
- nums[mid] > nums[end] --> min exist in [mid + 1, end]
- nums[mid] <= nums[end] --> min exist in [start, mid]

why use nums[end] as a criteria of comparison?
because nums[start] can be the answer, it make the analysis more complex.

__time:__ O(logn), n is #nums in the array

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0, end = nums.length - 1;
        while(start < end){

            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            //nums[mid] >= nums[start] also works
            if(nums[mid] > nums[end]){
                start = mid + 1;
            }else{
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[start];
    }
}
```
