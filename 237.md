#### 237. Delete Node in a Linked List
Write a function to delete a node (<u>except the tail</u>) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

__idea:__ this is a weird question. In this question, we don't have the reference to this list. We only can do a "fake" deletion. For example, ```1 -> x -> 2 -> 3```, replace x value by 2, and set x.next points to 3. This leads to the orginal node with value 2 was "skipped".
This node will be handled by garbage collection.  

__time:__ O(1)

```Java
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
}
```
