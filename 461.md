#### 461.Hamming Distance
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance. (0 â‰¤ x, y < 2^31)

__idea:__ XOR can show the different bits between two integers. We just need to count how many bits are in the XOR result. (Java built-in lib ```Integer.bitCount()```)

__time:__ O(k), k is the bits of integer.

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int res = x ^ y;
        int mask = 1;
        int dist = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++){
            if((res & mask) != 0){
                dist++;
            }
            mask = mask << 1;
        }

        return dist;
    }
}
```
