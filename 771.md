#### 771.Jewels and Stones
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
Note: The characters in J are distinct.
```
Example:
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```
__idea:__
1. read J and build jewels hash set.
2. read S and count jewels.

__time:__ O(m + n), m is #items in J, and n is #items in S.
```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        if(J.length() == 0 || S.length() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(char c : J.toCharArray()){
            set.add(c);
        }
        int count = 0;
        for(char c : S.toCharArray()){
            if(set.contains(c)){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
