#### 3.Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
```
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", length = 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", length = 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", length = 3.
Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
__idea:__ keep a hashmap whose key is the characters in string and value is its index, and keep two pointers, left and right which define the max substring. Move the right pointer to scan through the string , and meanwhile update the hashmap. If the character is already in the hashmap, then move the left pointer to the right of the same character last found. Because of the definition of substring, the two pointers can only move forward.

__time:__ O(n), n is #characters

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        if(s == null || s.length() == 0){
            return 0;
        }

        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();

        int maxLength = 0;
        for(int right = 0, left = 0; right < chars.length; right++){
            if(map.containsKey(chars[right])){
                //abcabcbb
                left = Math.max(left, map.get(chars[right]) + 1);
            }
            map.put(chars[right], right);
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```
