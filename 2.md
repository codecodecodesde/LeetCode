#### 2.Add Two Numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```
__idea:__ calculate the value of each node from left to right by currently available nodes in `l1` and `l2`, and use a variable `carry` to calculate carry cumulatively.

__notice:__ when both `l1` and `l2` are null, still need to check `carry` to decide whether the calculation can be stopped or not.

__time:__ O(n), n is the length of the longer linked list.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode head = dummy;

        int carry = 0;
        while(l1 != null || l2 != null){
            int val = carry;
            if(l1 != null){
                val += l1.val;
                l1 = l1.next;
            }
            if(l2 != null){
                val += l2.val;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }
            carry = val/10;
            ListNode newNode = new ListNode(val % 10);
            head.next = newNode;
            head = head.next;
        }

        if(carry != 0){
            head.next = new ListNode(1);
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
